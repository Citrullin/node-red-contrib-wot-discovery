# node-red-contrib-wot-discovery
Experimental Node-RED package for discovery in the Web of Things (WoT).
It provides a `wot-discovery` node that can be used for discovering and storing WoT Thing Descriptions (TDs) as well as a `wot-scripting` node that uses the WoT Scripting API (through the `node-wot` package) for triggering interaction affordances.

So far, only discovery using CoAP is supported. However, more ways of discovering and interacting with Things are supposed to be added soon.
